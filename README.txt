Title: Simple Test Driven programming

Objective: The goal of the project is NOT to display a particular ability in using Java but, rather, to display how quickly it has been learnt and used.

0. Summary.
This toy-project aims at demonstrating how the author has been able to quickly learn Java: starting from a little bit more than a 0 knowledge, in less than 8 working hours scattered in 3 working days (working after a full-time actual work), the author completed the exercise. The main challenges have been that of quickly learning Java syntax, solving problems related with reg-ex and understanding multi-thread programming.

1. Objective
Enclosed you will find some files of a simple project
which you should be able to open and modify in your environment.
In this project you will find three test classes: 

javathon.BaseMethodsTest
javathon.CollectionMethodsTest
javathon.BaseDataMethodsTest

Those three classes statically include
all methods you will need to expose in their corresponding source classes 

javathon.BaseMethods
javathon.CollectionMethods
javathon.BaseDataMethods

What we need you to do is to enrich those last three classes with the static method
the tests need to run successfully.

Please note we expect you not to modify any of the test case.
Feel free to add as many class as you need to the source.
